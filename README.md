# OSMO - A skin manager for osu!

 OSMO stands for "*O*pen *S*kin *M*anager for *o*su!" and builds upon the old [Skin Manager](http://https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/231747 "Skin Manager") from 2014. It uses the [Material Design In XAML Toolkit](https://github.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit "Material Design In XAML Toolkit") to give you a clean and easy to navigate UI.

### Status

*CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT*!

### First stable release ToDo

- Implement a forum template manager (with autofill)
- Simulator -> Test how your skin would look like in-game without starting osu!
- Auto-Updater
- Implement custom titlebar and remove MahApps.Metro dependency
- Translations
- Implement a custom file picker with Material Design style (and get rid of the default Win32 file picker)
- Skin element resize tool (for example create SD elements from HD elements)
