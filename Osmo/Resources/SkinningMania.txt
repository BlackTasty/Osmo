#
# Note: Only the name and supported formats are required. 
#       If you want to use different values for different versions, write it like this:
#       ranking-graph|.png|1.0:min308x156;min308x148
#       You can specify multiple version for one value like "1.0,2.0:308x148".
#
#       Animatable: Accepts only true or false. Every other value results in false
#		If you provide a version, than this element is only created/shown when the version matches the version inside skin.ini
#
#       Description: If you want to add a linebreak, use \

# Additional formatting tips:
# If you want to limit the maximum width and/or height, write it like this:
# max0x768
# 0 = unlimited
