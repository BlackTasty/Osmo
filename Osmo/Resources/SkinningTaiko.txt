# Date: 03.06.2018
# Entries are split like this:
#    Name|Supported formats|Suggested SD size|Animatable;Contains hyphen;Maximum frames;Frame order|Version|Description
#
# Note: Only the name and supported formats are required. 
#       If you want to use different values for different versions, write it like this:
#       ranking-graph|.png|1.0:min308x156;min308x148
#       You can specify multiple version for one value like "1.0,2.0:308x148".
#
#       Animatable: Accepts only true or false. Every other value results in false
#                   Contains hyphen: This tells the reader if a hyphen (-) is used
#                   Maximum frames: How many frames are detected by "osu!"?
#                   Frame order: The order in which the frames are being played
#
#       If you provide a version, than this element is only created/shown when the version matches the version inside skin.ini
#
#       Description: If you want to add a linebreak, use \
#
# Additional formatting tips:
# If you want to limit the maximum width and/or height, write it like this:
# max0x768
# 0 = unlimited
